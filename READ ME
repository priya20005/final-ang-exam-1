Travel Planner Application

Description
The Travel Planner application is built using Angular and allows users to plan and manage their travel itineraries. Users can explore destinations, view details of each destination, add destinations to their travel plans, and create custom itineraries. The application covers various Angular concepts and features, including handling forms, using observables, making HTTP requests with the Angular in-memory Web API, implementing authentication and route protection, dynamic components, using pipes, optimizing with lazy loading, adding offline capabilities with service workers, performing unit testing with NgRx, implementing Angular Universal, using Angular animations, and deploying the Angular app.

Features
1. Destination Exploration:
   Users can view a list of travel destinations, including names, images, descriptions, and ratings.
    Users can click on a destination to view its details, including additional information, attractions, and user reviews.

   - Implemented an observable to notify the component when destinations are added to or removed from the travel plan.
   
4. Pipes:
   Used a custom date pipe to display travel plan dates in a formatted date style.
   Created a custom pipe to filter destinations based on their category.
   
5. Angular In-Memory Web API:
    Set up the Angular in-memory Web API to mimic a backend server and store destination data. Used the API to make HTTP requests for fetching destination details and handling travel plans.
